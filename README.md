# Freddy Diengott -- Software Engineer

Welcome to the code for my portfolio site! This is a relatively simple site for me to share some basic info about myself, my personal projects, and some skills I have acquired as a software engineer. By day, I work as a frontend developer for Etrade from Morgan Stanley, where I work on a team maintaining a React component library and additionally am the subject matter expert for a small charts library that is built with D3.js.

Part way through covid, I transitioned from being an event planner, where I planned over 200 weddings, to taking a 4-month intensive coding boot-camp. My work as a frontend dev at a large company has taught me an enormous amount about efficient and clear systems, and it has refined my ability to write maintainable, scalable code.

Outside of work I think of myself as a fun, serious, quirky, sweet, interesting person. I have a bunch of hobbies and am an individual who very much lives by their beliefs (vegan, environmentalist, etc.). I love to sing (I have two degrees in classical singing), play the piano, cook, bike, rock climb, sew, watch movies, play video games, read, listen to podcasts, create and maintain friendships, go to museums, and learn to play my new clarinet, just to name a few things (sorry, I got carried away listing them).

I live in Brooklyn with my partner, a close friend, and our cat.
