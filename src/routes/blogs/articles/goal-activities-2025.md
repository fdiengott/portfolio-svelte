# Goal Activities in 2025

Lately, I've been listening to the podcast "[Philsophize This](https://www.philosophizethis.org/)" (shoutout to Stephen West!) fairly often, and the philosophical thought lately being discussed in the 20th century is how the goal of philosophy has gone from how one _should_ live, to how one _might_ live. So due to that, I've been thinking about what are things I can do to that pursuit that don't require a fundamental shift in my life.

Which leads me to this short exercise. In NYC, it is frankly, overwhelming all of the things one can do. So this document/page is a list of a bunch of activities that I want to do, that are far beyond the simple going out to dinner or movie. It will hopefully grow overtime and I'll slowly add more detailed plans and places. But a living document such as this requires curiosity, mistakes, ambition, and collaboration.

So here's to goals!

## List of NYC activities in no particular order

<div class="nyc-activities-start"> </div>

### Theater

I've mostly been going to [Playwrights Horizons](https://www.playwrightshorizons.org/) and will continue to, but should also try some other theaters. Maybe more musicals from time to time or experimental things.

Last year I also went to the Metropolitan opera once. So perhaps I should look at their season again.

### Comedy

Mostly stand-up. I've been to [Union pool](https://www.union-pool.com/calendar) a couple times, but should find other places.

### Jazz

I've been to [LunÀtico](https://www.barlunatico.com/music) and [Ornithology](https://www.ornithologyjazzclub.com/). I've also been procrastinating checking out [The Stone](http://thestonenyc.com/calendar.php) which is supposedly a little more avante-garde along with [Downtown Music Gallery](https://downtownmusicgallery.com/shows.php).

### Museum

tenement, poster, obviously art
