# Goal Activities 2025

Lately, I've been listening to the podcast "[Philsophize This](https://www.philosophizethis.org/)" (shoutout to Stephen West!) fairly often, and the philosophical thought lately being discussed in the 20th century is how the goal of philosophy has gone from how one _should_ live, to how one _might_ live. So due to that, I've been thinking about what are things I can do to that pursuit that don't require a fundamental shift in my life.

Which leads me to this short exercise. In NYC, it is frankly, overwhelming all of the things one can do. So this document/page is a list of a bunch of activities that I want to do, that are far beyond the simple going out to dinner or movie. It will hopefully grow overtime and I'll slowly add more detailed plans and places. But a living document such as this requires curiosity, mistakes, ambition, and collaboration.

So here's to goals!
