# Welcome to my blog!

If you are one of the few people that has found this page, welcome!

This blog is intended to be a repository for some general knowledge on software engineering, increasingly machine learning, and a number of other random things. I don't intend to publicize this in any way, but it will hopefully have some helpful collections of information I've distilled from many sources. If you have any questions you can reach out to my on linked in or find my email through my resume.
