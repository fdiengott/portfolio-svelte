// Notes:
/*
    Experiencing ego death accidentally during my last psilocybin, I completely lost track of my identity and my identifiable traits. Note only did I not recognize myself physically (I accidentally looked in the mirror even though I know better), I also did not know how my thoughts operated normally operated. Strangely, I asked myself some number of times how other people experience their internal thought-processes.

    I have a ton of interests and often find myself with little time to absorb them, and yet still feeling strangely lacking of skills and hobbies.

    I came into web development late, and am therefore quite happy with the outcome and the path. Not only do I very much enjoy the problem solving - I vastly enjoy focusing on something hard for some stretch and achieving flow state - and the monetary value society has assigned the career, but because I was (and perhaps still am) an artist (musician), I feel I get to operate on multiple societal levels; One of technical intellectualism (I love to watch civil engineering and city planning edutainment), one of popular culture (pop music, film, tv), one of musical intellectualism (jazz, classical music, etc), one of philosophical, moral questioning (effective altruism, veganism, environmentalism, etc.)

# It began with a whimper

It has been rather infrequent in my life for me to work out my thoughts through writing.
