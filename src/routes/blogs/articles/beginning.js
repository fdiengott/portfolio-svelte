// Notes:
/*
    Experiencing ego death accidentally during my last psilocybin, I completely lost track of my identity and my identifiable traits. Note only did I not recognize myself physically (I accidentally looked in the mirror even though I know better), I also did not know how my thoughts operated normally operated. Strangely, I asked myself some number of times how other people experience their internal thought-processes.

    I came into web development late, and am therefore quite happy with the outcome and the path. Not only do I very much enjoy the problem solving - I vastly enjoy focusing on something hard for some stretch and achieving flow state - and the monetary value society has assigned the career, but because I was (and perhaps still am) an artist (musician), I feel I get to operate on multiple societal levels; One of technical intellectualism (I love to watch civil engineering and city planning edutainment), one of popular culture (pop music, film, tv), one of musical intellectualism (jazz, classical music, etc), one of philosophical, moral questioning (effective altruism, veganism, environmentalism, etc.)

# It began with a whimper

It has been rather infrequent in my life for me to work out my thoughts through writing. So my intention for this adventure is then, perhaps, to attempt to document some of my thoughts during this moment of my life, whether it be about technology, philosophy, or even food. Or maybe it is a chance to think in public (somewhat since I doubt anyone will _actually_ read this) and try out some ideas which I will dispose of some time later.

So let us begin here: I have a ton of interests and a fair amount of skills. Yet even with this deluge of options, I am lately still striving, craving, hungry for something to obsess over. I go through distinct phases where I become incredibly involved in one thing. This thing has been a video game (e.g. Factorio or Hades), or a project (e.g. building my partner, Jo's website), or a TV show (e.g. Better Call Saul). And when I finish one or find myself without such a thing to latch myself to, I clutch my stomach in hunger.

This striving is interesting something I like about myself. I try to ride it, set it up in ways to get the most out of it before I move on, like the time I made sure to finish sewing on dozens of patches onto a pair of pants before losing interest in my sewing machine (which still gets mending and altering use from time to time).
